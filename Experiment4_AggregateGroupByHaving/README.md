# Experiment 4: Aggregate Functions, Group By and Having Clause

## AIM
To study and implement aggregate functions, GROUP BY, and HAVING clause with suitable examples.

## THEORY

### Aggregate Functions
These perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

- *MIN()* – Smallest value  
- *MAX()* – Largest value  
- *COUNT()* – Number of rows  
- *SUM()* – Total of values  
- *AVG()* – Average of values

*Syntax:*
sql
SELECT AGG_FUNC(column_name) FROM table_name WHERE condition;

### GROUP BY
Groups records with the same values in specified columns.
*Syntax:*
sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name;

### HAVING
Filters the grouped records based on aggregate conditions.
*Syntax:*
sql
SELECT column_name, AGG_FUNC(column_name)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column_name
HAVING condition;


*Question 1*
--
-- How many male and female doctors are there in each medical specialty?

Sample table:Doctors Table
For example:

Result
Specialty          Gender    TotalDoctors

Dermatology        Male      1
Gastroenterology   Female    4
Gastroenterology   Male      1
Pediatrics         Female    1
Pediatrics         Male      2
sql
--select Specialty,Gender,count(*) as TotalDoctors
from Doctors
group by Specialty,Gender
order by Specialty,Gender;

*Question 2*
---
-- Write the SQL query that achieves the grouping of data by city, calculates the total income for each city, and includes only those cities where the total income sum is greater than 200,000.

*Question 4*
---
-- Write the SQL query that achieves the grouping of data by occupation, calculates the average work hours for each occupation, and includes only those occupations where the average work hour falls between 10 and 12.

Sample table: employee1



For example:

Result
occupation  AVG(workhour)
----------  -------------
Business    10.0
Engineer    12.0
